# Sample Radiology Reports for Testing Enhanced Analysis

## Sample Report 1: Basic Chest X-ray Report
```
CHEST X-RAY REPORT

CLINICAL HISTORY: Cough and fever for 3 days

TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral chest radiographs obtained

FINDINGS:
- The lungs are clear bilaterally with no focal consolidation
- Heart size is within normal limits
- No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
- Bony structures are intact

IMPRESSION: 
Normal chest radiograph

Dr. Smith, Radiologist

## Sample Report 2: CT Scan Report (with intentional issues for testing)
```
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST

CLINICAL HISTORY: Abdominal pain, rule out appendicitis

TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following oral and IV contrast administration

FINDINGS:
- The liver appears normal in size and attenuation
- The gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen are unremarkable
- There is mild wall thickening of the appendix measuring 8mm
- No free fluid or air is identified
- The kidney show normal enhancement bilaterally
- Bowel loops appear normal

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild appendiceal wall thickening, possibly early appendicitis
2. No other acute findings

Radiologist: Dr. Johnson
```

## Sample Report 3: MRI Brain Report (Complex case)
```
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST

CLINICAL HISTORY: Headache and visual disturbances

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1, T2, FLAIR, and DWI sequences obtained. Post-contrast T1 sequences performed.

FINDINGS:
- There is a 2.5 cm enhancing mass in the right frontal lobe
- Surrounding vasogenic edema is present
- No midline shift or hydrocephalus
- The remainder of the brain parenchyma appears normal
- No acute infarct on DWI
- The ventricular system is normal in size

IMPRESSION:
1. Right frontal enhancing mass lesion with surrounding edema
2. Differential includes primary brain neoplasm vs metastatic disease
3. Recommend neurosurgical consultation
