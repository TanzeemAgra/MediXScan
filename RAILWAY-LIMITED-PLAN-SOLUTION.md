Your Railway account is on a limited plan which has deployment restrictions.

## ðŸ“‹ SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Upgrade Railway Plan (Recommended)
1. Visit: https://railway.com/account/plans

railway status
```

#### B. Remove Unused Services
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Delete any unused services/projects
3. Keep only your MediXScan project

#### C. Optimize Dockerfile for Free Tier
Update your Dockerfile for minimal resource usage:

```dockerfile
# Use lighter Python image
FROM python:3.11-alpine

# Minimal system dependencies
RUN apk add --no-cache postgresql-dev gcc musl-dev

# Your existing Dockerfile content...
```

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment Platforms

#### Free Alternatives:
1. **Render.com** - Free PostgreSQL + Web Service
2. **Fly.io** - Free tier with Docker support
