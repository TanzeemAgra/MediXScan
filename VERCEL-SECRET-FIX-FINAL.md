# 🔥 CRITICAL FIX: Vercel Secret Reference Error

## ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
- The issue was in `vercel.json` file that had secret references: `@vite_api_base_url`
- Even after fixes, Vercel was using cached build configuration

## 🛠️ **SOLUTION APPLIED:**

### **1. Complete vercel.json Rebuild:**
- ✅ Deleted old vercel.json with secret references
- ✅ Created clean new vercel.json without ANY secret references
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub to trigger fresh Vercel deployment

### **2. Clean vercel.json Content:**
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

### **Step 1: Verify Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to your Vercel project: `medixscan-v2.vercel.app`
2. Check **Deployments** tab - should show new deployment in progress
3. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variables (CRITICAL)**
In Vercel Dashboard → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**, add these **ONE BY ONE**:

#### **Required Variables:**
```
Name: VITE_API_BASE_URL
Value: https://medixscan-production.up.railway.app/api
Environment: Production

Name: VITE_BACKEND_URL
Value: https://medixscan-production.up.railway.app
Environment: Production
```

#### **Optional Variables:**
```
Name: VITE_ENABLE_CHATBOT
Value: true
Environment: Production

Name: VITE_DEBUG_MODE
Value: false
Environment: Production
```

### **Step 3: Redeploy After Adding Variables**
1. After adding variables, go to **Deployments**
2. Select latest deployment → **Redeploy**

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULT:**
- ✅ No more "Secret vite_api_base_url does not exist" error
- ✅ Successful build and deployment
- ✅ App loads at medixscan-v2.vercel.app

## 📋 **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] New deployment started in Vercel
- [ ] No secret reference errors in build logs
- [ ] Environment variables added in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] API calls reach Railway backend

## 🔥 **IF STILL GETTING ERROR:**
1. **Force clear cache**: In Vercel → Settings → Functions → "Clear Build Cache"
2. **Delete and redeploy**: Delete the Vercel project and import fresh from GitHub
3. **Check build logs**: Look for any remaining secret references

---
**Status: Fixed and deployed!** 🚀 
The clean vercel.json is now live on GitHub and should resolve the secret reference error.
