## 🚀 TO CREATE ON RAILWAY PRODUCTION

### Option 1: Django Management Command (Recommended)
The Django management command has been created and pushed to the repository.

**Steps to execute on Railway:**
1. Open Railway dashboard
2. Go to your MediXScan project
3. Open the terminal/console
4. Run: `python manage.py create_rugrel_admin --force`

### Option 2: Railway CLI Command
If you have Railway CLI access:
```bash
railway run python manage.py create_rugrel_admin --force
```

### Option 3: Manual Creation via Railway Console
If the management command doesn't work, you can create manually:
```python
# Run in Railway Python console
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group

User = get_user_model()

# Create or get user
user, created = User.objects.get_or_create(
    email='admin@rugrel.in',
    defaults={
        'username': 'admin@rugrel.in',
        'first_name': 'Rugrel',
        'last_name': 'Admin',
        'is_staff': True,
        'is_superuser': True,
        'is_active': True,
    }
)

user.set_password('Rugrel@321')
user.save()

print(f"User created/updated: {user.email}")
print(f"Is superuser: {user.is_superuser}")
```
